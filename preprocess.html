                        elementary particles, but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules. For
                        particles, because of their extremely short wavelengths, wave properties usually cannot be

                    <p>Bohr regarded the "duality " as a fundamental or metaphysical fact of nature. A given kind of

                        different physical settings. He saw such duality as one aspect of the concept of . Bohr regarded
                        renunciation of the cause-effect relation, or complementarity, of the space-time picture, as

                        quite in the usual quantum mechanical account considered by Bohr. He saw it in what is called ,
                        which generates an entirely new concept of fields which exist in ordinary space-time, causality

                    <p>—the original —argued that all things in the universe, including light, are composed of
                        indivisible sub-components (light being some form of solar atom). At the beginning of the 11th
                        Century, the Arabic scientist wrote the first comprehensive ; describing refraction, reflection,
                        and the operation of a pinhole lens via rays of light traveling from the point of emission to
                        the eye. He asserted that these rays were composed of particles of light. In 1630, popularized
                        and accredited the opposing wave description in his , showing that the behavior of light could
                        be re-created by modeling wave-like disturbances in a universal medium ("plenum"). Beginning in
                        1670 and progressing over three decades, developed and championed his , arguing that the
                        perfectly straight lines of demonstrated light's particle nature; only particles could travel in
                        such straight lines. He explained by positing that particles of light accelerated laterally upon
                        entering a denser medium. Around the same time, Newton's contemporaries and —and later
                        —mathematically refined the wave viewpoint, showing that if light traveled at different speeds
                        in different media (such as water and air), could be easily explained as the medium-dependent
                        propagation of light waves. The resulting was extremely successful at reproducing light's
                        behavior and was subsequently supported by 's 1801 discovery of interference. The wave view did
                        not immediately displace the ray and particle view, but began to dominate scientific thinking
                        about light in the mid 19th century, since it could explain polarization phenomena that the
                        alternatives could not.</p>

                    <p>At the close of the 19th century, the reductionism of atomic theory began to advance into the
                        atom itself; determining, through physics, the nature of the atom and the operation of chemical
                        reactions. Electricity, first thought to be a fluid, was now understood to consist of particles
                        called . This was first demonstrated by in 1897 when, using a , he found that an electrical
                        charge would travel across a vacuum (which would possess infinite resistance in classical
                        theory). Since the vacuum offered no medium for an electric fluid to travel, this discovery
                        could only be explained via a particle carrying a negative charge and moving through the vacuum.
                        This <i>electron</i> flew in the face of classical electrodynamics, which had successfully
                        treated electricity as a fluid for many years (leading to the invention of , , , and ). More
                        importantly, the intimate relation between electric charge and electromagnetism had been well
                        documented following the discoveries of and . Since electromagnetism was <i>known</i> to be a
                        wave generated by a changing electric or magnetic <i>field</i> (a continuous, wave-like entity
                        itself) an atomic/particle description of electricity and charge was a . Furthermore, classical
                        electrodynamics was not the only classical theory rendered incomplete.</p>

                    <p>In 1901, published an analysis that succeeded in reproducing the observed of light emitted by a
                        glowing object. To accomplish this, Planck had to make an ad hoc mathematical assumption of
                        quantized energy of the oscillators (atoms of the ) that emit radiation. Einstein later proposed
                        that electromagnetic radiation itself is quantized, not the energy of radiating atoms.</p>
                    <p>, the emission of electromagnetic energy due to an object's heat, could not be explained from
                        classical arguments alone. The of classical mechanics, the basis of all classical thermodynamic
                        theories, stated that an object's energy is partitioned equally among the object's vibrational .
                        But applying the same reasoning to the electromagnetic emission of such a thermal object was not
                        so successful. That thermal objects emit light had been long known. Since light was known to be
                        waves of electromagnetism, physicists hoped to describe this emission via classical laws. This
                        became known as the problem. Since the equipartition theorem worked so well in describing the
                        vibrational modes of the thermal object itself, it was natural to assume that it would perform
                        equally well in describing the radiative emission of such objects. But a problem quickly arose:
                        if each mode received an equal partition of energy, the short wavelength modes would consume all
                        the energy. This became clear when plotting the which, while correctly predicting the intensity
                        of long wavelength emissions, predicted infinite total energy as the intensity diverges to
                        infinity for short wavelengths. This became known as the .</p>
                    <p>In 1900, hypothesized that the frequency of light emitted by the black body depended on the
                        frequency of the <i>oscillator</i> that emitted it, and the energy of these oscillators
                        increased linearly with frequency (according to <i>h</i>, where E = hν). This was not an unsound
                        proposal considering that macroscopic oscillators operate similarly: when studying five of equal
                        amplitude but different frequency, the oscillator with the highest frequency possesses the
                        highest energy (though this relationship is not linear like Planck's). By demanding that
                        high-frequency light must be emitted by an oscillator of equal frequency, and further requiring
                        that this oscillator occupy higher energy than one of a lesser frequency, Planck avoided any
                        catastrophe; giving an equal partition to high-frequency oscillators produced successively fewer
                        oscillators and less emitted light. And as in the , the low-frequency, low-energy oscillators
                        were suppressed by the onslaught of thermal jiggling from higher energy oscillators, which
                        necessarily increased their energy and frequency.</p>
                    <p>The most revolutionary aspect of Planck's treatment of the black body is that it inherently
                        relies on an integer number of oscillators in with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators
                        <i>give</i> their entire energy to the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, as
                        often as they are <i>excited</i> by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and
                        beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally created an
                        atomic theory of the black body, but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light,
                        where the black body never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less
                        than <b>hν</b>. However, once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he
                        denounced particles of light as a limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.

                    <p>While Planck had solved the ultraviolet catastrophe by using atoms and a quantized
                        electromagnetic field, most contemporary physicists agreed that Planck's "light quanta"
                        represented only flaws in his model. A more-complete derivation of black body radiation would
                        yield a fully continuous and 'wave-like' electromagnetic field with no quantization. However, in
                        1905 took Planck's black body model to produce his solution to another outstanding problem of
                        the day: the , wherein electrons are emitted from atoms when they absorb energy from light.
                        Since their existence was theorized eight years previously, phenomenon had been studied with the
                        electron model in mind in physics laboratories worldwide.</p>
                    <p>In 1902 discovered that the energy of these ejected electrons did <i>not</i> depend on the
                        intensity of the incoming light, but instead on its <i>frequency</i>. So if one shines a little
                        low-frequency light upon a metal, a few low energy electrons are ejected. If one now shines a
                        very intense beam of low-frequency light upon the same metal, a whole slew of electrons are
                        ejected; however they possess the same low energy, there are merely <i>more of them</i>. The
                        more light there is, the more electrons are ejected. Whereas in order to get high energy
                        electrons, one must illuminate the metal with high-frequency light. Like blackbody radiation,
                        this was at odds with a theory invoking continuous transfer of energy between radiation and
                        matter. However, it can still be explained using a fully classical description of light, as long
                        as matter is quantum mechanical in nature.</p>
                    <p>If one used Planck's energy quanta, and demanded that electromagnetic radiation at a given
                        frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quantum
                        <b>hν</b>, then the photoelectric effect could be explained very simply. Low-frequency light
                        only ejects low-energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single
                        photon. Increasing the intensity of the low-frequency light (increasing the number of photons)
                        only increases the number of excited electrons, not their energy, because the energy of each
                        photon remains low. Only by increasing the frequency of the light, and thus increasing the
                        energy of the photons, can one eject electrons with higher energy. Thus, using Planck's constant
                        <i>h</i> to determine the energy of the photons based upon their frequency, the energy of
                        ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency; the gradient of the line being
                        Planck's constant. These results were not confirmed until 1915, when , who had previously
                        determined the charge of the electron, produced experimental results in perfect accord with
                        Einstein's predictions. While the energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck's constant, the
                        existence of photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the effect, of which a
                        modern experiment can be performed in undergraduate-level labs. This phenomenon could only be
                        explained via photons, and not through any semi-classical theory (which could alternatively
                        explain the photoelectric effect). When Einstein received his in 1921, it was not for his more
                        difficult and mathematically laborious and , but for the simple, yet totally revolutionary,
                        suggestion of quantized light. Einstein's "light quanta" would not be called until 1925, but
                        even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave-particle duality.
                        Electromagnetic radiation propagates following linear wave equations, but can only be emitted or
                        absorbed as discrete elements, thus acting as a wave and a particle simultaneously.</p>

                        light seemed incapable of explaining. He did so by postulating the existence of , of light
                        energy with particulate qualities.</p>
                    <p>In the , it was observed that shining a light on certain metals would lead to an in a .
                        Presumably, the light was knocking electrons out of the metal, causing current to flow. However,
                        using the case of potassium as an example, it was also observed that while a dim blue light was
                        enough to cause a current, even the strongest, brightest red light available with the technology
                        of the time caused no current at all. According to the classical theory of light and matter, the
                        strength or of a light wave was in proportion to its brightness: a bright light should have been
                        easily strong enough to create a large current. Yet, oddly, this was not so.</p>

                        (above a certain <i>threshold</i> value) could knock an electron free. For example, photons of
                        blue light had sufficient energy to free an electron from the metal, but photons of red light
                        did not. One photon of light above the threshold frequency could release only one electron; the
                        higher the frequency of a photon, the higher the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, but no
                        amount of light (using technology available at the time) below the threshold frequency could
                        release an electron. To "violate" this law would require extremely high-intensity lasers which

                    <p>Heisenberg originally explained this as a consequence of the process of measuring: Measuring
                        position accurately would disturb momentum and vice versa, offering an example (the "gamma-ray
                        microscope") that depended crucially on the . The thought is now, however, that this only partly
                        explains the phenomenon, but that the uncertainty also exists in the particle itself, even
                        before the measurement is made.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the modern explanation of the uncertainty principle, extending the first put forward by
                        and , depends even more centrally on the wave nature of a particle: Just as it is nonsensical to
                        discuss the precise location of a wave on a string, particles do not have perfectly precise
                        positions; likewise, just as it is nonsensical to discuss the wavelength of a "pulse" wave
                        traveling down a string, particles do not have perfectly precise momenta (which corresponds to
                        the inverse of wavelength). Moreover, when position is relatively well defined, the wave is
                        pulse-like and has a very ill-defined wavelength (and thus momentum). And conversely, when
                        momentum (and thus wavelength) is relatively well defined, the wave looks long and sinusoidal,
                        and therefore it has a very ill-defined position.</p>

                    <p>De Broglie himself had proposed a construct to explain the observed wave-particle duality. In
                        this view, each particle has a well-defined position and momentum, but is guided by a wave
                        function derived from . The pilot wave theory was initially rejected because it generated
                        non-local effects when applied to systems involving more than one particle. Non-locality,
                        however, soon became established as an integral feature of (see ), and extended de Broglie's
                        model to explicitly include it.</p>
                    <p>In the resulting representation, also called the or Bohmian mechanics, the wave-particle duality
                        vanishes, and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the
                        particle's motion is subject to a guiding equation or . <i>"This idea seems to me so natural and
                            simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, that it is a
                            great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored"</i>, .</p>
                    <p>The best illustration of the <i>pilot-wave model</i> was given by Couder's 2010 "walking
                        droplets" experiments, demonstrating the pilot-wave behaviour in a macroscopic mechanical

                        act like waves.</p>

                        was conducted in the 1970s using the . Neutrons, one of the components of the , provide much of
                        the mass of a nucleus and thus of ordinary matter. In the neutron interferometer, they act as
                        quantum-mechanical waves directly subject to the force of gravity. While the results were not
                        surprising since gravity was known to act on everything, including light (see and the ), the
                        self-interference of the quantum mechanical wave of a massive fermion in a gravitational field

                        molecules and their heavier derivatives, which are composed of 58 and 114 atoms respectively. In

                    <p>Wave–particle duality is deeply embedded into the foundations of . In the of the theory, all the
                        information about a particle is encoded in its , a complex-valued function roughly analogous to
                        the amplitude of a wave at each point in space. This function evolves according to a
                        (generically called the ). For particles with mass this equation has solutions that follow the
                        form of the wave equation. Propagation of such waves leads to wave-like phenomena such as
                        interference and diffraction. Particles without mass, like photons, have no solutions of the
                        Schrödinger equation so have another wave.</p>
                    <p>The particle-like behavior is most evident due to phenomena associated with . Upon measuring the
                        location of the particle, the particle will be forced into a more localized state as given by
                        the uncertainty principle. When viewed through this formalism, the measurement of the wave
                        function will randomly "", or rather "", to a sharply peaked function at some location. For
                        particles with mass the likelihood of detecting the particle at any particular location is equal
                        to the squared amplitude of the wave function there. The measurement will return a well-defined
                        position, (subject to ), a property traditionally associated with particles. It is important to
                        note that a measurement is only a particular type of interaction where some data is recorded and
                        the measured quantity is forced into a particular . The act of measurement is therefore not
                        fundamentally different from any other interaction.</p>
                    <p>Following the development of the ambiguity disappeared. The field permits solutions that follow
                        the wave equation, which are referred to as the wave functions. The term particle is used to
                        label the irreducible representations of the that are permitted by the field. An interaction as
                        in a is accepted as a calculationally convenient approximation where the outgoing legs are known
                        to be simplifications of the propagation and the internal lines are for some order in an
                        expansion of the field interaction. Since the field is non-local and quantized, the phenomena
                        which previously were thought of as paradoxes are explained. Within the limits of the
                        wave-particle duality the quantum field theory gives the same results.</p>

                        duality, but rather a system exhibits both particle properties and wave properties
                        simultaneously, and particles are guided, in a fashion, by the pilot wave (or its "") which will
                        direct them to areas of in preference to areas of . This idea is held by a significant minority

                    <p>At least one physicist considers the "wave-duality" as not being an incomprehensible mystery.
                        L.E. Ballentine, <i>Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development</i>, p. 4, explains:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>When first discovered, particle diffraction was a source of great puzzlement. Are "particles"
                            really "waves?" In the early experiments, the diffraction patterns were detected
                            holistically by means of a photographic plate, which could not detect individual particles.
                            As a result, the notion grew that particle and wave properties were mutually incompatible,
                            or complementary, in the sense that different measurement apparatuses would be required to
                            observe them. That idea, however, was only an unfortunate generalization from a
                            technological limitation. Today it is possible to detect the arrival of individual
                            electrons, and to see the diffraction pattern emerge as a statistical pattern made up of
                            many small spots (Tonomura et al., 1989). Evidently, quantum particles are indeed particles,
                            but whose behaviour is very different from classical physics would have us to expect.</p>

                    <p>The (2007) may suggest that it is possible to simultaneously observe both wave and particle
                        properties of photons. This claim is, however, disputed by other scientists.</p>
